# Deep-Coat-Internship
Here are some AutoCAD drawing from my summer 2025 internship.
I do not have acess to every single file, but here are some of them.
The Anechoic Chamber is part of the main project I was working on. I drew it up quickly on AutoCAD to show the main components of the design I cam up with and fabricated.
The twist mechanism is a mechanism I designed for a customer that is a compact 90Â° rotary mechanism designed for high loads in multiple directions. 
The code all works together. The data anaysis code turn the raw data from the osciloscope and VNA, and turn it into usable data in term of attenuation and sheild effectiveness. The data combination code combines and organizes the data from the data we already have. It also plots the points of the data and zooms into certian part of the graph so we can see the treands. The Trendline and predictions code give a trendline of the data and also give future predictions based on the data.
